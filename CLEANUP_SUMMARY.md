# Deep Cleanup Summary

**Date:** 2025-01-14 22:23:00

## Overview
Completed comprehensive cleanup of obsolete code from legacy local architecture (AsyncWebServer, local database, complex system management). System now runs VPS-only architecture with ESP32 as simple HTTP client.

## Files Moved to .cleanup_backup/

### Source Files (20 .cpp files)
- api.cpp, dashboard.cpp, database.cpp, persistence.cpp
- relays.cpp, sensors.cpp, rule_engine.cpp
- relay_serialization.cpp, relay_state_store.cpp, relay_timeouts.cpp
- system.cpp, system_events.cpp, system_ota.cpp
- system_time.cpp, system_wifi.cpp, system_watchdog.cpp
- power_loss.cpp, time_source.cpp, embedded_assets.cpp
- diagnostic_minimal.cpp, config_schema.cpp
- **rate_limiter.cpp** (orphaned, not referenced anywhere)

### Header Files (19 .h files in legacy_headers/)
- api.h, dashboard.h, database.h, embedded_assets.h
- fs_utils.h, metrics.h, nvs_utils.h, persistence.h
- power_loss.h, rate_limiter.h
- relay_serialization.h, relay_state_store.h, relay_timeouts.h
- relays.h (legacy complex version), rule_engine.h
- sensors.h (legacy complex version), system.h
- time_source.h, config_schema.h

### Other Archived Items
- old_frontend/ (data/ directory with HTML/CSS/JS dashboard)
- old_docs/ (API_CHANGELOG.md, BUGFIX_REPORT.md, HTTPS_SETUP.md)
- mongodb-backend/ (Docker compose setup)
- vps-deployment/ (deployment scripts)
- main_original.cpp.backup, rule_engine.cpp.old
- main_vps_client.cpp, build_vps_client.sh

## Active Files After Cleanup

### Source Files (4 files)
- **main.cpp** - VPS client main loop (WiFi + NTP + HTTP client logic)
- **sensors_simple.cpp** - DHT11 + 2x soil moisture (simple version)
- **relays_simple.cpp** - Basic 4-relay control
- **vps_client.cpp** - HTTP client for VPS communication

### Header Files (7 files in include/)
- **config.h** - Main configuration with all structs/enums (SensorData, RelayState, etc.)
- **pins.h** - Pin definitions for ESP32 NodeMCU-32S
- **secrets.h** - WiFi credentials (gitignored)
- **secrets.example.h** - Example secrets template
- **vps_config.h** - VPS endpoint configuration
- **vps_client.h** - VPSClient class definition
- **sensors.h** - Simplified SensorManager (new, minimal)
- **relays.h** - Simplified RelayManager (new, minimal)

## New Simplified Headers Created
After moving legacy headers to backup, created minimal replacements:

- **include/sensors.h** - Clean SensorManager without complex state management, NTC/DS18B20 support, or advanced statistics
- **include/relays.h** - Clean RelayManager without rule engine, NVS persistence, or advanced features

Both new headers use structures from config.h (SensorData, RelayState, RelayMode, SystemStats) to avoid duplication.

## Compilation Result
âœ… **SUCCESS**
```
RAM:   [=         ]  14.5% (used 47508 bytes from 327680 bytes)
Flash: [=======   ]  71.1% (used 932141 bytes from 1310720 bytes)
========================= [SUCCESS] Took 1.92 seconds =========================
```

- Flash: 71.1% (932,141 bytes) - **unchanged from before cleanup**
- RAM: 14.5% (47,508 bytes) - **slightly reduced** (was 15.0%)
- No compilation errors
- All dependencies resolved correctly

## Architecture Notes
Current system is **VPS-only architecture**:
- ESP32 is simple HTTP client (no AsyncWebServer)
- All logic runs on VPS (Node.js + Express + MongoDB)
- No local LittleFS database
- No OTA updates (requires manual upload via USB)
- No complex state management or NVS persistence
- No power loss recovery
- Relay states controlled from VPS (polled every 5s)
- Sensor data sent to VPS every 30 seconds
- Rule engine runs entirely on VPS server
- Manual/Auto mode managed server-side

## Statistics
- **Total files moved**: 20 (.cpp) + 19 (.h) + directories = **39 code files + docs/tools**
- **Code reduced by**: ~95% (from ~15,000 lines to ~800 lines active code)
- **Flash usage**: Maintained at 71.1% (no increase)
- **RAM usage**: Reduced to 14.5% (was 15.0%)
- **Active environments**: 1 (greenhouse-vps-client)
- **Compilation time**: ~2 seconds

## Next Steps
1. âœ… Compilation verified successful
2. ðŸ“‹ Test firmware upload to ESP32 (optional but recommended)
3. ðŸ“‹ Monitor system for 30 days to ensure no issues
4. ðŸ“‹ After 30-day stability period: Delete .cleanup_backup/ permanently
5. ðŸ“‹ Optional: Remove commented `[env:greenhouse]` from platformio.ini
6. ï¿½ï¿½ Optional: Create architecture documentation

## Safety Net
All moved files are in `.cleanup_backup/` directory:
- **Not tracked by git** (.gitignore updated)
- Can be recovered at any time if needed
- Recommended to keep for **30 days minimum** before deletion
- After 30 days of stable operation: `rm -rf .cleanup_backup/`

## Configuration Changes
- **platformio.ini**: Changed `default_envs = greenhouse-vps-client`
- **platformio.ini**: `build_src_filter` already excluded legacy files
- **.gitignore**: Added `.cleanup_backup/` exclusion
- **include/**: Created simplified sensors.h and relays.h

## Recovery Instructions
If any issues arise and old code is needed:

```bash
# Restore all legacy source files
cp .cleanup_backup/*.cpp src/

# Restore all legacy headers
cp .cleanup_backup/legacy_headers/*.h include/

# Revert platformio.ini to use 'greenhouse' environment
# Edit platformio.ini: default_envs = greenhouse
```

## Conclusion
Deep cleanup completed successfully. Project now has clean separation between VPS-only client code (active) and legacy local architecture code (archived). Compilation verified at 71.1% Flash with no errors. System ready for continued operation with simplified, maintainable codebase.
